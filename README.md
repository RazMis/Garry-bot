# Garry-bot
This is an customizable bot that can be talked to. The main use is for streaming but you can use it as a talking companion.

How to use:
1. Have py installed
2. Install all the libraries used (I use Pycharm Community Edition so you can download with that)
3. Make an account on Deepseek and buy some tokens (It's very cheap don't worry)
4. Use the personality.txt to wrrite a personality pormpt to follow
5. Use audio_config.json to modify the voice though pitch, volume and speed
That's it. Have fun with it.
